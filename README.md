![hero page](https://github.com/anav5704/t3-todo/blob/main/docs/t3-todo.png)

This is a simple, and my second ever todo app made wiith the legendary T3 stack. Had lots of fun working with tRPC. It's super easy and simple to use. Don't we all love abstraction layers on top of other abstraction layers.

## Technologies Used
- Next JS 14
- TailwindCSS
- tRPC
- Prisma 
- Serverless PostgreSQL

## Getting Started

First fork and clone the repo. Then, run ```npm install``` to download all the dependencies. Now, set up your environmental variables. Make a ```.env``` file in the root of your project with the following variables:

```
DATABASE_URL
DIRECT_URL
```

Once that is done, run ```npm run dev``` to view it on localhost.
